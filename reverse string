Given a string, write a function that uses recursion to reverse it.

Requirements
You MUST use pen and paper or a whiteboard to answer this, no coding allowed!

SOLUTION
Hopefully you remember this problem, you've already seen it! The solution is:

def reverse(s):
    
    # Base Case
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s

    # Recursion
    return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]
