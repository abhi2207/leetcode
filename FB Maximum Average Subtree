Maximum Average Subtree
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

Simple DFS solution and understandable code -
Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

    def maximumAverageSubtree(self, root: TreeNode) -> float:
        if not root:
            return 0

            # if node is None, return 0 as sum and 0 as no. of nodes
            if node is None:
                return (0, 0)
            
            # go to left subtree and get total sum on that subtree, and the total nodes
            sum_left, node_cnt_left = dfs(node.left)

            # calculate the total sum
            _total_sum = node.val + sum_left + sum_right
            # calculate the total no. of nodes
            _total_nodes = 1 + node_cnt_left + node_cnt_right
            # compute the avg
